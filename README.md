# Practical-EDM-implementation

When I have heard about EDM last time, I had an urge to make some experiments.  
This process is so versatile and it couples mechanics with electricity. Two principles I like to deal with.  
Having strong electric background I thought I may contribute by some improvements to the existing designs.
