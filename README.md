# Practical-EDM-implementation

When I have heard about EDM last time, I had an urge to make some experiments.  
This process is so versatile and it couples mechanics with electricity. Two principles I like to deal with.  
Having strong electric background I thought I may contribute by some improvements to the existing designs.

### !!! WARNING !!!
__EDM is using high voltage.__

This is a project in progress which I make in my spare time with several other projects in paralell.  
Please watch, and give feedback if you like this topic.  
When I see interest, I will increase the proirity :)
