# 01_basic

first trial to switch on LT124x
final schema is lt1241-bare.sch, circuit built on prototype panel
2 ICs been trashed during trials
setup been finalised while patching application circuit for partially broken one

c1: Vref(8)
c2: Isense(3)
c3: Vout(6)
c4: Vosc(4)

IC1:LT1244
Ucc = 16V
Icc = 90 mA
temperature rise to 100C in 5 sec !?

Meas 1-3 taken at steady state (t=100C)

Meas 4-6 taken at switch on
	- out is activated in (almost each clock periode!?

Circuit was built on breadboard (what is discouraged anyway)


Meas 7-8 R3>1M as if output was not sinking!?

---------------

Meas 10-11 new lt1244 performs as expected!!!

Meas 12 steady state

Icc = 18 mA
no excessive heating
t=40C
R3>1M

Meas 13-14 : IC1:LT1245
Ucc=12V
Icc=18mA
